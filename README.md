# Fern Forecasting
This project explores demand forecasting and customer sentiment analysis for Fern (Boston Rose Florist) a family-owned floral shop at 225 Massachusetts Ave, Boston, MA.

Built for MKTG 4604: *Creating Business Value with Data and AI Technologies*  
Northeastern University, Spring 2026

**Team:** Blythe Berlinger, Molly Varrenti, Dhruv Laungani, Srihari Raman  
**Instructor:** Professor Daniel Katz

## What This Project Does

Fern is a small florist that orders inventory based on intuition. This leads 
to two costly problems: over-ordering (flowers go to waste) and under-ordering 
(stockouts during holiday spikes). Over 2023–2024, Fern wasted **$41,394** in 
unsold inventory.

We built two AI tools to fix this:

1. **Demand Forecasting** : a Gradient Boosting model that predicts weekly 
   order volume per product category using holiday flags, weather, lag sales, 
   and university event calendars.

2. **Customer Sentiment Analysis** : a VADER + LDA pipeline that scores 310 
   customer reviews by occasion and surfaces which products and occasions drive 
   satisfaction (or dissatisfaction).

Both tools feed into a **Streamlit management dashboard** that gives Fern's 
owner a weekly order recommendation, a retrospective waste report, and a live 
customer sentiment tracker.

## Repository Structure

There are two distinct parts to this project:

**1. Analysis Notebooks** — proof-of-concept analysis submitted to Canvas  
**2. Dashboard Code** — interactive Streamlit tool built on top of the analysis

## Data

All data was simulated by Professor Katz based on our project proposal 
data wish list. Date coverage: **January 2023 – December 2024**.

| Dataset | Rows | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `fern_orders.csv` | 5,769 | One row per transaction: product, occasion, quantity, revenue |
| `fern_calendar.csv` | 731 | One row per day: holidays, weather, university event flags |
| `fern_inventory.csv` | 942 | One row per product per week: units ordered, sold, wasted |
| `fern_reviews.csv` | 310 | One row per review: platform, star rating, review text, occasion |

---

## Analysis Notebooks and Workflow

### 1. src/notebooks/01_eda.ipynb — Exploratory Data Analysis

- Introduces the four datasets and surfaces the core business problem.
- Merges orders, calendar, inventory, and review data
- Identifies strong demand spikes driven by holidays and occasions
- Quantifies inventory inefficiency

Key finding: Fern wasted $41,394 over 2023–2024 (10.8% of revenue), hence the need for data-driven ordering.

### 2. models/demand_forecasting.ipynb — Demand Forecasting Model

- Builds and evaluates the Gradient Boosting model used to predict demand.
- Constructs time-based and calendar features (holiday flags, lags, seasonality)
- Compares Linear Regression vs Gradient Boosting
- Evaluates model performance and interpretability

Results:
- Linear Regression fails (R² = -0.124) due to non-linearity. 
- RF was also tested, but had slightly lower R^2
- Gradient Boosting performs well (R² = 0.692, MAE = 2.31 units)

This notebook provides the modeling foundation for the Streamlit dashboard.

### 3. src/notebooks/02_sentiment_analysis.ipynb — Customer Sentiment Analysis

- Analyzes 310 customer reviews to uncover demand drivers.
- VADER sentiment scoring → overall sentiment = +0.47
- LDA topic modeling → identifies 5 key customer themes

Results:
- Walk-in customers = high volume, low satisfaction
- Valentine's Day & Mother’s Day = high demand AND high sentiment

### 4. src/notebooks/03_value_argument.ipynb — Business Impact Simulation

- Translates model predictions into financial value.
- Simulates model-driven ordering vs current approach
- Applies a 5% safety buffer
- Estimates cost savings

Result:
- 32% reduction in waste costs
- $851 projected annual savings

## Model Performance

Results from `models/demand_forecasting.ipynb`:

| Model | MAE | R² | Notes |
| Model | MAE | R² | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Linear Regression | 4.49 | -0.124 | Baseline  (fails due to non-linear holiday spikes) |
| Gradient Boosting | 2.31 | 0.664 | Final model used in simulation and dashboard |

The Linear Regression failure is intentional. It demonstrates that 
floral demand is non-linear and justifies the Gradient Boosting approach.

## Streamlit Dashboard

The dashboard in `app/` turns the notebook analysis into a tool 
Fern's owner could use every week. Run it with:

```bash
streamlit run app/Home.py
```

| Page | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Home** | Alert-driven summary (flags waste, stockouts, sentiment drops) |
| **Demand Outlook** | 8-week forward forecast by product category |
| **Order Sheet** | Recommended weekly order with adjustable safety buffer |
| **How We Did** | Retrospective waste simulation vs model-based ordering |
| **Customer Sentiment** | VADER scores, occasion leaderboard, sentiment trend |

---

## Key Findings

- Fern wasted **$41,394** over 2023–2024 - 10.8% of sold-unit revenue
- Our GB model predicts weekly demand within **~2.3 units** on average
- Model-based ordering reduces waste costs by **32%** (~$851/year)
- **Birthday and wedding** arrangements have the highest customer sentiment
- **Walk-in customers** are the highest-volume but lowest-satisfaction 
  segment, suggesting understocking for impulse buyers
- **Valentine's Day and Mother's Day** have both high demand AND high 
  sentiment, confirming these are the right occasions to stock heavily

---

## Setup

### Prerequisites
